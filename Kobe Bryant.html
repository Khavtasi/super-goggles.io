   <h1 style="color:white"> Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
     Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time,[3][4][5][6][7] Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
      Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. 
      He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.</h1>

      <h1 style="color:white">Bryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season.
        He also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. Bryant was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003 but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries.
        In the following summer, he had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case.
        Along with LeBron James, he was one of the first two players to be publicly named to the 2006–2008 U.S. preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo.
        However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and did not participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.</h1>
